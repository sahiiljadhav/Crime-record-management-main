In the realm of public safety and justice, efficient crime management is more crucial than ever. We're thrilled to introduce our state-of-the-art solution, the Crime Record Management System (CRMS), engineered to transform the way law enforcement agencies manage crime data. This system aims to streamline interactions between citizens and police officers, ensuring efficient FIR (First Information Report) processing and charge sheet management.

## 🌟 Technologies Employed:

- Frontend: HTML5, CSS, EJS
- Backend: Django
- Database: MySQL
- Python libraries: Seaborn, Matplotlib

## 🔹 Features:

- **FIR Registration**: Citizens can log in to register FIRs, which then require acceptance from a police officer through their dedicated login.
- **Charge Sheet Management**: Once an FIR is accepted, the process moves to charge sheet preparation. Citizens receive updates on the status of their charge sheet – whether it’s still incomplete or completed and viewable.
- **User and Officer Profiles**: Both citizens and officers can edit their profiles, change passwords, and receive notifications about updates.
- **Seamless Interaction**: Facilitates smooth communication and updates between the accused and the police officer.

This project ensures transparency and efficiency in handling crime reports, benefiting both the public and law enforcement.
